KERNEL PARAMETERS

    /proc/sys/*         = path to defaults
    sysctl              = cli utility for managing: get and temporarily set values inside /proc/sys/*
    /etc/sysctl.conf    = permanent set values: apply values on system start

TCP WINDOW SIZE = derivative of:

    1. receiver window = how much data receiver can handle

        - mechanism name:   flow control
        - the purpose:      to avoid receiver buffer overflow
        - estimation:       receiver set value to TCP header 'Window size' field
        - value:            might be less or equal to receiver buffer free space 

    2. congestion window = how much data the network can transfer

        - mechanism name:   congestion control
        - the purpose:      to avoid network overloading
        - estimation:       sender uses congestion control algorithms (CCA) 
        - value:            greater than maximum segment size (MSS) allowed by receiver         

    WINDOW SIZE = the samellest of receiver and congestion window
    DATA IN FLIGHT = the data have been sent but not acknowledged

TCP RECEIVER BUFFER SIZE

    Kernel level        = /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
    TCP level           = /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem (values: min default max)
    particular socket   = man 7 socket >> socket options >> SO_RCVBUF
                          man 8 ss >> Options >> --memory 

    Notes:

        - actual SO_RCVBUF size will be twice as much as set value
        - it seems that `man 7 socket` description of SO_RCVBUF is incorrect:
            man: "... the maximum allowed value is set by the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max file"
            reality: almost entire TCP core code refers to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem only

List of questions to be answered:
    -        use socket(..., ... | SOCK_NONBLOCK, ...) with 'poll' on 'connect'
    2.4      how to set connection/response timeout for TCP + how TCP predicts Round-trip time (RTT)
    2.4      how to get information about Window actual size = buffer available size
    2.6      how TRANSPORT layer (e.g. TCP) parameters connected with APPLICATION layer experience?
    -        local vs. external IP in context of bind() function and 'ifconfig' utility
    2.11     "... MTU IPv4 min - 68 byte ..." - incorrect formulation
