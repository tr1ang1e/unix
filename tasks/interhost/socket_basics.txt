SOCKET = abstraction over the two-sides communication flow:
    1. server  
    2. client

Kernel implementation is based on BERKLEY SOCKETS, also called:
    - POSIX sockets
    - BSD sockets

SOCKET is represented as a FILE in system and therefore has
FILE DESCRIPTOR which is related to combination of 4 values:
    - server IP
    - server PORT
    - client IP
    - client PORT
These values are set by:
    1. server side = bind(...) for server 'IP:port' + accept(...) for client 'IP:port'
    2. server side = bind(...) for client 'IP:port' + connect(...) for client 'IP:port'       
                     bind is unnecessary for client (see 'sendto' / 'connect' for UDP / TCP)
